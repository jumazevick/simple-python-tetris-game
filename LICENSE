Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work that contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program" refers
to any such program or work, and "you" refers to the licensee.

1. You may copy, distribute, and modify verbatim copies of the Program's
source code under this License. You must include a copyright notice,
disclaimer of warranties, and this License with each copy. You may
charge a fee for physical copies or offer warranty protection.

2. If you modify the Program, you may distribute the modified version
under this License, provided you also:
   a) Include prominent notices stating changes and modification dates.
   b) License the modified work as a whole under this License at no
      charge to third parties.
   c) Ensure any interactive use announcements include a copyright notice,
      disclaimer, and reference to this License.

3. You may distribute the Program or a work based on it in object code
or executable form under Sections 1 and 2, provided you also offer source
code or provide a written offer for source code distribution for at least
three years.

4. You may not sublicense, modify, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify,
sublicense, or distribute the Program is void and terminates your rights
under this License.

5. By distributing the Program, the recipient receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, or modify the Program under these
terms. You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of these
rights by recipients.

6. If conditions contradict this License due to legal actions or patents,
you cannot distribute the Program. This ensures compliance with this License
under all circumstances.

7. This License may incorporate geographical distribution limitations by
the original copyright holder. The Free Software Foundation may publish
revised versions of the License.

8. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

9. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE
LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

When developing new programs using the code from this repo, attach this notice to effectively convey that
the program is free software under this License. Include a copyright notice,
disclaimer, and reference to the GNU General Public License.

This License does not permit incorporation into proprietary programs. For
libraries, consider using the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.
